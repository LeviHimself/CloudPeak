# Weather Web Application

## Overview
This is a simple weather web application that fetches and displays weather information for a specified location. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it utilizes a weather API to retrieve real-time weather data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
weather-web-app
├── public
│   ├── index.html          # Main HTML document for the web application
│   ├── favicon.ico         # Favicon for the web application
│   └── assets
│       └── styles.css      # CSS styles for the web application
├── src
│   ├── app.js              # Main JavaScript file for application logic
│   ├── api
│   │   └── weatherApi.js   # Functions for fetching weather data from the API
│   └── components
│       └── WeatherDisplay.js # Component for displaying weather information
├── package.json             # Configuration file for npm
└── README.md                # Documentation for the project
```

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd weather-web-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**: 
   You can start the application using a local server. If you have a server setup, navigate to the `public` directory and open `index.html` in your browser. Alternatively, you can use a live server extension in your code editor.

## Usage
- Enter a location in the input field to fetch the current weather data.
- The application will display the weather information, including temperature, humidity, and conditions.

## Fetching Weather Data
The application fetches weather data using the Fetch API. The process involves:
1. **Defining the API Endpoint**: The URL of the weather API is specified, including necessary query parameters (like city name and API key).
2. **Fetching Data**: The `fetch` function is used to make a GET request to the API endpoint, returning a promise that resolves to the response.
3. **Handling the Response**: The response is checked for success (status code 200). If successful, the JSON data is parsed.
4. **Returning the Data**: The parsed data is returned for use in the application, such as displaying it in the `WeatherDisplay` component.
